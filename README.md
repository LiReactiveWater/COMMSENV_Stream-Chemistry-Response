Significant Stream Chemistry Response to Temperature Variations in a High-Elevation Mountain Watershed

**Abstract**: High-elevation mountains are “water towers for humanity” and experience more rapid warming than low elevation locations. High-elevation streams can potentially offer early glimpse of water and soil response to warming. Here we present hydroclimatic and biogeochemical data from Coal Creek, Colorado in the central Rocky Mountains at elevations of 2,700 to 3,700 m, where air temperatures have increased by about 2°C since 1980. We analyze water chemistry every other day from 2016 to 2019. The data indicate distinct responses of different solutes to inter-annual hydroclimatic variations. Specifically, concentrations of solutes from rock weathering remain relatively stable. In contrast, solutes that are active in soils, including dissolved organic carbon, peak during snowmelt, with maximum concentrations in warm years tripling those in cold years and annual average doubling those in cold years. We therefore advocate for persistent monitoring of high-elevation streams for early signs of rapid earth surface response to warming.
